_Shiva Nandi's classes are very professional and enlightening. I had been practicing yoga for a year before I joined Shiva's yoga classes. He conducts his class, with patience, love and caring guidance. I remembered how he taught us to go into a proper forward bend step by step by asking us to place ourselves against a wall and bend forward, pushing our hips and back of our legs against the wall and allow our body weight to lean forward. Instantly, I felt my tight hamstrings and know that if I want to improve my forward bend I have to release my tight hamstrings._  
_In another one of his classes he spoke about Avatar and how the avatars can connect with the earth, feel one with nature and animals. This speech brought alot of deep thinking to me and since then I had been practicing yoga with thanks and gratitude to Mother Earth._  
_In each and every yoga classes of Shiva I learnt new things not only in Yoga Asanas but also way of life and yoga philosophy. He enlightened my connection with Mother Earth and changed the perception of how I viewed life._  
_Shiva Nand's yoga classes are beautiful and it is an experience, which speaks for itself. One has to attend his classes to feel and understand how special it is. I am one of the fortunate people whom had the special grace of the universe to be able to attend his classes and I am very thankful for it._

_Resonance, sincerity, compassion, honesty, intuition, authenticity, grace...these are only a few words to describe the imprints of Shiva's teachings and the essence that pervades the background of each class. With such a humble nature, Shiva effortlessly inspires every student to strive towards a state of yoga, widening perspectives to go beyond asanas, beyond the mat and into every aspect of our lives. Not only in the yoga shala, but also in such compassionate interactions with his son, did I realise the depths of Shiva's heart and the way in which he sees the Divine in all...a quality that every yogi should embody. To practice with Shiva is truly a blessing!_
