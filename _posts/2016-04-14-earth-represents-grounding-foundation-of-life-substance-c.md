This training will focus on the most essential skills necessary to step into a classroom upon completion and confidently guide a 60/75/90 minute Hatha yoga practice based on strength and learned alignment.   This training is a time tested program with graduates currently teaching. The course is primarily aimed at learning to teach yoga, life as a yoga teacher and simple techniques for self realization.    This is a 22-day, full-time training program. The program offers a positive practical Yantra philosophy grounded in recognizing life's sweetness combined with essential principles of hatha yoga alignment. To ensure teachers retain the practical classroom skills and academic study of the history and literature of yoga there are weekly summaries and exams to reflect the progress."
