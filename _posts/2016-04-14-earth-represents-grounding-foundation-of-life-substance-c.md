description: "Earth represents grounding, foundation of life, substance, connection to life path, and family roots.\_Earth is a strong, simple, static and unchanging sequence of asanas aimed at all levels. Here you will learn how to teach a simple strong sequence aimed at getting the individual grounded in the basics. The aim of the earth module is to get the yogi confident in teaching a solid all levels set sequence of hatha yoga, you may adjust this to a 60/90 min class.\_ Earth takes up 70 hours of study, mostly asana practice and teaching methods. This you could say is your bread and butter, you will know this inside out and feel confident in teaching a solid earth series to the public, knowing key alignment, useful dialog and timings for each pose.Feel the movement of water as it cascades, crystal and clear over the rocks of a waterfall, then compare it with the limpid stillness of a glade side pool, and how both these things may be expressed within your own nature.\_"

Welcome to a 22 day Hatha Yoga Teacher training held in Koh Samui Island Thailand on the 22nd of July 2016 Strength, vitality, a deep recollection of spirit, a mood of service to the bigger play of life, intelligent daily practice and daily theory-based workshops for developing a strong foundation in teaching yoga. This training will focus on the most essential skills necessary to step into a classroom upon completion and confidently guide a 60/75/90 minute Hatha yoga practice based on strength and learned alignment. This training is a time tested program with graduates currently teaching. The course is primarily aimed at learning to teach yoga, life as a yoga teacher and simple techniques for self realization. This is a 22-day, full-time training program. The program offers a positive practical Yantra philosophy grounded in recognizing life's sweetness combined with essential principles of hatha yoga alignment. To ensure teachers retain the practical classroom skills and academic study of the history and literature of yoga there are weekly summaries and exams to reflect the progress.
