Welcome to a 22 day Hatha Yoga Teacher training held in Koh Samui Island Thailand on the 22nd of July 2016 Strength, vitality, a deep recollection of spirit, a mood of service to the bigger play of life, intelligent daily practice and daily theory-based workshops for developing a strong foundation in teaching yoga. This training will focus on the most essential skills necessary to step into a classroom upon completion and confidently guide a 60/75/90 minute Hatha yoga practice based on strength and learned alignment. This training is a time tested programme with graduates currently teaching. The course is primarily aimed at learning to teach yoga, life as a yoga teacher and simple techniques for self realization. This is a 22-day, full-time training programme. The programme offers a positive practical Yantra philosophy grounded in recognizing life's sweetness combined with essential principles of hatha yoga alignment. To ensure teachers retain the practical classroom skills and academic study of the history and literature of yoga there are weekly summaries and exams to reflect the progress.
